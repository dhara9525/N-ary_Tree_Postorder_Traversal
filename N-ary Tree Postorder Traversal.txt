Program: Univalued N-ary Tree Postorder Traversal
Submission Detail: 36 / 36 test cases passed.

Given an n-ary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

For example, given a 3-ary tree:

{"$id":"1","children":[{"$id":"2","children":[{"$id":"5","children":[],"val":5},{"$id":"6","children":[],"val":6}],"val":3},{"$id":"3","children":[],"val":2},{"$id":"4","children":[],"val":4}],"val":1}

Return its postorder traversal as: [5,6,3,2,4,1].
